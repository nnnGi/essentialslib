# Essentials Library (EssentialsLib)

## [ðŸ‘‰ Get Shortcut without Login](/%64ownload/55278/)

With an Integrated Updater, Dictionary and List Utilities, Global Variables, vCard Generation and more, the Essentials Collection will bring your shortcut development to the next level!

Essentials Library is meticulously crafted to empower your shortcuts with an expedited method for implementing essential functionalities and facilitating seamless integration.
Functioning as a foundational resource, it is replete with invaluable features that elevate your shortcuts. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive set of tools to streamline your automations, all accessible through APIs, all encapsulated within a single shortcut.

It aims to replace most of the functionality of apps such as Actions to reduce the need for outside apps other than the base iOS / Apple apps preinstalled. Such actions that have been replaced include: The vCard Actions, In Dictionary, Global Variables, IsOnline and Invert Dictionary.

**Essentials is under active development. New beta versions might break existing tools and may need fixing. All bug reports go to the [Docs](https://essentialslibrary.fibery.io/@public/)**
